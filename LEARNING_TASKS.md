- [ ] **Plan Your Agent**

  - [ ] Choose a specific domain (e.g., Weather, Finance, Cooking)
  - [ ] Design what UI it should have
  - [ ] Plan what functionality it needs

- [ ] **Implementation Steps**

  - [ ] Add new agent type to `available-agents.ts`
  - [ ] Create new agent component in `components/agents/`
  - [ ] Add agent to the main `canvas.tsx`
  - [ ] Update chat instructions to include your agent

- [ ] **Test and Iterate**
  - [ ] Test agent activation through chat
  - [ ] Verify UI switching works correctly
  - [ ] Debug any state management issues

### 🔌 **Advanced MCP Integration**

- [ ] **Build Custom MCP Server**

  - [ ] Create a new server script (e.g., `weather_server.py`)
  - [ ] Implement specific tools for your domain
  - [ ] Test local server functionality

- [ ] **Dynamic Configuration**
  - [ ] Add your server to the MCP configuration UI
  - [ ] Test dynamic loading of your tools
  - [ ] Verify integration with MCP agent
